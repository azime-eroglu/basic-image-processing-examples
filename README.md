# basic-image-processing-examples
While doing this project, I got help from coding on skicit-image.org site.
While applying the morphological processes, the image created after the application of the selected process is not saved, and then the selected process is applied on the original image. Code integrity is not provided in this clause. I ignored the requirement for code integrity in this item, as morphological transformations are low in success.
